### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Manthan Chauhan and I'm a Web Developer. 

My domination is in Backend (Django) but I can also work on frontend, like [this website](http://www.online-portfolio.live/about/). I'm comfortable with both SQL and NoSQL databases and have fair amount of experience in each. 

Apart from that, I'm a Python enthusiast and a Competitive Programmer (C++ / Python). I'm always looking forward to new opportunities, please reach-out if you have one.
