### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Manthan Chauhan and I'm a Software Engineer.

My domination is primarily in Backend Engineering but to me technology itself is an holistic domain where I keep building new things. I started my career in 2020 and since then my diverse experiences include building web server applications, event-driven systems, recommendation & search systems, database engines, diffusion model applications, AI agents & MCP servers.

I never shy away from solving new problems and I'm always eager to learn new tech. I have professional experience in working with Java, Python & Golang. Here are a few of my projects,

1. [Custom built database engine based on Bitcask architecture in Go](https://github.com/manthanchauhan/key_val_db_engine)
2. [Virutal try-on application based on stable diffusion in Python](https://github.com/manthanchauhan/virtual-try-on)
3. [MCP server for customer support agent in Go](https://github.com/manthanchauhan/mcp-mysql-go)
